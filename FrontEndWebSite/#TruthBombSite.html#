    <!-- Description of site -->
    <p>Truth Bomb is a website created to help you verify the sites you use, in regards to news and media. We have created this because we have noticed there is general distrust with the media currently and we believe this is the solution. Our site allows you to rate and review how trustworthy a website is. We then collate this data to create a scale of how trustworthy your favourite websites are. If this isn't enough for you, download our extension, which will instantly inform you when you're visiting a website how trustworthy the source is. </p>
